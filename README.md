# HR-Dashboard
This repo consists of creation of interactive dashboard using Power BI

This project mainly focuses on building a dashboard which assists HR to understand the data.
The dashboard has 3 sections Home, Action and Details where each section describes the data in the form of charts and numbers to understand its insights.
It describes the employee's who are due for promotion and those who are not, the percentage of employees on service and the percentage of employees getting retrenched.
Creation of dashboard gives out a clear image of total men and women working in that company.
Addition of DAX functions has helped to give more proper insights.
